With older versions, you'll only see a one node large rotor.

With MATERIAL beeing

         steel ingot for 4-blade windmill
	 homedecor plastic sheet for 3-blade turbine
         white wool for historic windmill sails
         wood for historic windmill without sails (rotates very slowly)
         stick for us-style farm windmill

Clockwise- and counterclockwise rotating rotors can be crafted into each other.


The axis is mostly a decorative node to which you can attach your mill rotors.
